        <p>Hello, I am Aria Dolatabadian, a crop geneticist and genomics researcher. I have a diverse background in plant science, having worked as a postdoctoral research fellow at the Department of Plant Science, University of Manitoba, and currently serving as a research officer at the <a class="lab-link" href="https://batleylab.net/">Batley Lab</a>, University of Western Australia.</p>
        <p>My passion lies in exploring the fascinating realm where genetics, genomics, and plant pathology intersect. Specifically, my research focuses on understanding plant-pathogen interactions within two significant pathosystems: <span class="italic">Brassica napus-Leptosphaeria maculans</span> and <span class="italic">B. napus-Verticillium longisporum</span>. By combining my expertise in plant pathology with advanced bioinformatics and computational biology techniques, I aim to unravel the underlying mechanisms of these interactions.</p>
        <p>A key aspect of my work involves identifying and diagnosing fungal pathogens affecting plants in the field and laboratory settings. I employ cutting-edge molecular techniques and leverage my extensive knowledge of plant pathology to develop, analyse, and visualise genomic data related to these plant-pathogen interactions.</p>
        <p>I am exceptionally skilled in using Python and R programming languages, ranging from basic to advanced. I utilise these programming skills in the context of plant genetics, genomics, and agriculture.</p>
        <p>Through my research, I strive to advance our understanding of crop genetics, genomics, and plant pathology. I am driven by the desire to make a meaningful impact in sustainable agriculture and help address plant diseases and pathogen resistance challenges.</p>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me and my research interests. I am excited to continue pushing the boundaries of knowledge in the field and collaborating with fellow researchers to make a positive difference in crop science.</p>
