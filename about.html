        <p>Hello, I am Aria Dolatabadian, a crop geneticist and genomics researcher. I have a diverse background in plant science, having worked as a postdoctoral research fellow at the Department of Plant Science, University of Manitoba, and currently serving as a research officer at the Batley Lab, University of Western Australia.
My passion lies in exploring the fascinating realm where genetics, genomics, and plant pathology intersect. Specifically, my research focuses on understanding plant-pathogen interactions within two significant pathosystems: Brassica napus-Leptosphaeria maculans and B. napus-Verticillium longisporum. By combining my expertise in plant pathology with advanced bioinformatics and computational biology techniques, I aim to unravel the underlying mechanisms of these interactions.
A key aspect of my work involves identifying and diagnosing fungal pathogens affecting plants in the field and laboratory settings. I employ cutting-edge molecular techniques and leverage my extensive knowledge of plant pathology to develop, analyse, and visualise genomic data related to these plant-pathogen interactions.
I am exceptionally skilled in using Python and R programming languages, ranging from basic to advanced. I utilise these programming skills in the context of plant genetics, genomics, and agriculture, as well as in the exciting fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
Through my research and programming expertise, I strive to advance our understanding of crop genetics, genomics, and plant pathology. I am driven by the desire to make a meaningful impact in sustainable agriculture and help address plant diseases and pathogen resistance challenges.
Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me and my research interests. I am excited to continue pushing the boundaries of knowledge in the field and collaborating with fellow researchers to make a positive difference in crop science.
